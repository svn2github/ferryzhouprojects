== To Run
1. open ball.ini in pov-ray, select [640x480 No AA] (below the New icon) or whatever, click Run. Then 30 images will be generated in the same folder of the ini file. Copy these files to another directory.
2. to add another stereo view animation, change the first parameter (x position) of the location and look_at and then Run again.

You can change the configurations by modifying the parameters in ball.ini (for animation) and ball.pov (for scene).
